# Client-Server API Challenge - "May the dollar rate be forever in your favor!" ðŸ’¸

Hi!! I`m Jessica and sometimes Milena!
Welcome to this repository, where we combine Go, context with timeouts and SQLite database magic! ðŸ˜Ž

## What Is This Challenge?

## How to Run

 ### 1. In Terminal #1: Start the server:
 `go run server.go`

 If everythingâ€™s peachy, youâ€™ll see... 
 well, you`ll see.

 ### 2. In Terminal #2: Run the client:
 `go run client.go`

 And check the file cotacao.txt to see the current dollar rate. ðŸ’°
 
 ### 3. Whereâ€™s the Database?
 The server creates/uses cotacao.db to store the exchange rate history.
 To take a peek, use SQLite:
 `sqlite3 cotacao.db` or `sqlite3 /server/cotacao.db`
